## TODO:  
The task includes a peer review of other project solutions. The review should address 
questions about:
- the proper selection of technologies and the criteria, used for making the choices
- the quality of the design
- the readability of the diagrams and the code
- the readiness for further extention and upgrade of the system with new 
microservices
- the proper use of standards, recommendations, and the best practices od software 
development
